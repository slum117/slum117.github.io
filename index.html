<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
	Paramveer Singh operates a business that plans various events from catering, decoration, and planning full events like weddings.<br>
	He would like a website so that potential clients are able to find his business more easily and so that some of the work<br>
	that is required of him would become automated.<br>
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	We are designing a website with various functions. For example, we will provide customers with the ability to see past<br>
	events in the gallery, along with a way to contact event organizers using the UI in the website. A big part of the focus will<br>
	be on how the customer interacts with the website so that event organizers will have more information when they meet with<br>
	them. So the website will asks for information such as what type of event does the customer plan to have and what time will<br>
	be a good time for the customer to meet with an event organizer. There will also be a panel for the customer to include more<br>
	information should they desire to do so.<br>
	The minimum goals would be to create a fully functioning website that allows customers to find the business and from there,  <br>
	contact the organizers.<br>
</p>
