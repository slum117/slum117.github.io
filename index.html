<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
	Our client, Paramveer Singh, has a business that is an event planning organization called Events by Param.<br> 
	They plan, design and coordinate various events, with a focus on making the client’s life easier<br>
	by providing them with the best vendors. Vendors range from décor, photography, venue, catering,<br>
	entertainment and many more. Their goal is to save clients time and money by providing step by step coordination.<br>
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	We are designing a website with various functions. For example, we will provide customers with the ability to see past<br>
	events in the gallery, along with a way to contact event organizers using the UI in the website. A big part of the focus will<br>
	be on how the customer interacts with the website so that event organizers will have more information when they meet with<br>
	them. So the website will asks for information such as what type of event does the customer plan to have and what time will<br>
	be a good time for the customer to meet with an event organizer. There will also be a panel for the customer to include more<br>
	information should they desire to do so.<br>
	The minimum goals would be to create a fully functioning website that allows customers to find the business and from there,  <br>
	contact the organizers.<br>
</p>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	We build a website capable of allowing potential customers to contact Events by Param. In addition we also allow those customers<br>
	to see what Events by Param can offer them.<br>
