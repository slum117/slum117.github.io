<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
	Our client, Paramveer Singh, has a business that is an event planning organization called Events by Param.<br> 
	They plan, design and coordinate various events, with a focus on making the client’s life easier<br>
	by providing them with the best vendors. Vendors range from décor, photography, venue, catering,<br>
	entertainment and many more. Their goal is to save clients time and money by providing step by step coordination.<br>
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	<!--
	We are designing a website with various functions. For example, we will provide customers with the ability to see past<br>
	events in the gallery, along with a way to contact event organizers using the UI in the website. A big part of the focus will<br>
	be on how the customer interacts with the website so that event organizers will have more information when they meet with<br>
	them. So the website will asks for information such as what type of event does the customer plan to have and what time will<br>
	be a good time for the customer to meet with an event organizer. There will also be a panel for the customer to include more<br>
	information should they desire to do so.<br>
	The minimum goals would be to create a fully functioning website that allows customers to find the business and from there,  <br>
	contact the organizers.<br>
	-->
	Currently our client's business is operating heavily on social media. We hope to reduce that reliance by producing a website<br>
	so that the client-business interaction is able to operate more independently of social media. The website will also allow for<br>
	better employee-employer communication by providing a calendar so that employees can see their schedules along with messaging<br>
	the administrators, and being able to view seating/table arrangements.<br>
</p>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	A website that allows potential customers to contact Events by Param, while also being able to view past events that Events by <br>
	Param has hosted. These potential customers would also be able to see the services that is offered without contacting an organizer.<br>
	If they wish to select a service, they can do so in the services page, otherwise if they wish to contact an organizer they can do<br>
	so by using the contact form on the landing page.<br>

</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	We hope to make our product stand out by making the website efficient and streamlined. Potential customers would be able<br>
	to easily navigate through the website and look through the various pages on the website. If they so wish to contact an<br>
	organizer and have them help plan an event, they will be able to easily do so through a contact form provided on the<br>
	landing page. They will also be able to easily see what services are provided to them through the services page, which<br>
	would streamline the amount of work organizers have to do.<br>
